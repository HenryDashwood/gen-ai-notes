With just one click we can get anything we need; directions, recipes, how-to’s, even our weather forecast for the week. Imagine if you could do all of that without having to leave your house. AI technology has made that possible.\n\nAI is a form of artificial intelligence that allows machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intervention. It can be used in many different ways, from virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa to self-driving cars and even robots that can do household chores. The possibilities are endless and it’s up to us to figure out how best to use them.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of AI technology is its ability to analyze data and make predictions based on that data. This means that businesses can use AI to better understand their customers and tailor their products or services to meet their needs. It also means that doctors can use AI to diagnose diseases more accurately and quickly, which could save countless lives.\n\nHowever\n\n\n\nasync def callback(contents: str):\n    llms = {}\n\n    if \"mistral\" not in llms:\n        llms[\"mistral\"] = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n            \"TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF\",\n            model_file=\"mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf\",\n            gpu_layers=1,\n        )\n\n    llm = llms[\"mistral\"]\n    response = llm(contents, stream=True, max_new_tokens=1000)\n    message = \"\"\n\n    for token in response:\n        message += token\n        yield message\n\n\nt = callback(\"AI is going to\")\n\nasync for value in t:\n    print(value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n revolution\n revolutionize\n revolutionize the\n revolutionize the way\n revolutionize the way we\n revolutionize the way we interact\n revolutionize the way we interact with\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines,\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is in\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is in the\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is in the field\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is in the field of\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is in the field of robot\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is in the field of robotics\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is in the field of robotics.\n revolutionize the way we interact with machines, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is in the field of robotics.

In the context of the video transcript, the speaker\nis discussing the use of neural networks and how they can be trained to perform\nvarious tasks. The prompt template is an important aspect of this process, as it\nprovides a clear and consistent structure for the training data.\n\nThe speaker explains that neural networks are made up of a large number of\nparameters, or \"neurons\", which work together to solve complex problems. These\nneurons are organized in a structure that simulates neural tissue, and can be\ntrained using data from the internet. In order to effectively train a neural\nnetwork, the data must be presented in a standardized format, which is where the\nprompt template comes in.\n\nThe prompt template is used to provide a consistent structure for the data,\nwhich allows the neural network to learn and make predictions based on patterns\nwithin the data. This is important because it allows the network to make\nconnections and recognize patterns across different datasets, which ultimately\nleads to more accurate predictions.\n\nThe prompt template also plays a role in the training process by providing a\nbaseline for the network to compare against. The speaker explains that when\ntraining a neural network, a small\n\n\n\n\nloader = WebBaseLoader(\n    web_paths=(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",),\n    bs_kwargs=dict(parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(class_=(\"post-content\", \"post-title\", \"post-header\"))),\n)\ndocs = loader.load()\n\nOur loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. Even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, models can struggle to find information in very long inputs.\nTo handle this we’ll split the Document into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time.\nIn this case we’ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which will recursively split the document using common separators like new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.\nWe set add_start_index=True so that the character index at which each split Document starts within the initial Document is preserved as metadata attribute “start_index”.\n\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)\nsplits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n\nNow we need to index our 66 text chunks so that we can search over them at runtime. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and insert these embeddings into a vector database (or vector store). When we want to search over our splits, we take a text search query, embed it, and perform some sort of “similarity” search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity — we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are high dimensional vectors).\nWe can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the Chroma vector store and OpenAIEmbeddings model.\n\nvectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=GPT4AllEmbeddings())\n\nbert_load_from_file: gguf version     = 2\nbert_load_from_file: gguf alignment   = 32\nbert_load_from_file: gguf data offset = 695552\nbert_load_from_file: model name           = BERT\nbert_load_from_file: model architecture   = bert\nbert_load_from_file: model file type      = 1\nbert_load_from_file: bert tokenizer vocab = 30522\n\n\nWe need to define our logic for searching over documents. LangChain defines a Retriever interface which wraps an index that can return relevant Documents given a string query.\nThe most common type of Retriever is the VectorStoreRetriever, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval.\n\nretriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=\"similarity\", search_kwargs={\"k\": 6})\n\n\nretrieved_docs = retriever.invoke(\"What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?\")\n\n\nretrieved_docs\n\n[Document(page_content='Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/'}),\n Document(page_content='Challenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging.

The retrieval component typically employs some form of similarity or relevance scoring to determine which portions of the knowledge source are most pertinent to the input query.\nGeneration: The retrieved documents or snippets are then provided to a large language model, which uses them as additional context for generating a more detailed, factual, and relevant response.\n\nRAG can be particularly useful when the pre-trained language model alone may not have the necessary information to generate accurate or sufficiently detailed responses since standard language models like GPT-4 are not capable of accessing real-time or post-training external information directly."
